# VectorSolver

A helper for solving vector physics problems

---

## How To Use:

* Go to [`kmek.github.io/VectorSolver/`](https://kmek.github.io/VectorSolver/)
* Click on the `+ Add Vector` button below the graph to add a vector
* Enter either a `magnitude` at a `degree` or an (`x`, `y`) coordinate for a vector
   * The other form will be automatically calculated
* The resulting vector and the equilibrium vector will be automatically calculated and displayed in the two boxes below the graph
   * The resulting vector will be drawn on the graph as a dashed black line, the equilibrium vector will not be drawn
* Additional vectors can be added with the same `+ Add Vector` button
* The colorful square on the left of each vector is a colorpicker, it can be used to change the color of its corresponding vector on the graph
* The checkbox on the right enables or disables the vector
   * A disabled vector will not be drawn on the graph or included in the resulting & equilibrium vectors
* The `0.00` button in the bottom left corner determines the decimal all calculations are rounded to
   * Currently this can be changed from `0` to `0.0000` decimal places
